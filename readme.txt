/* This website is IsshoTabe, a website communication website that provides a video calling service for university students to hang out and socialize while eating. */


Overview of the project

- The index page of IsshoTabe (homepage) is home.html. Meanwhile, the landing page that explains the  (ideal) functions of the website is landing-page.html

To return to this homepage, you can click on the Manabu logo on the header on most other pages. 

- On the website, there are:
   + 1 homepage
   + 1 landing page introducing the main website
   + 2 pages of a login page and a register page
   + 1 page for a texting chat feed 
   + 1 page listing the video chatrooms of the user
   + 1 subpage of the video chatroom
   + 1 page of prototyping the video call/meeting

- Due to my lack of coding skills, I apologize that apart from buttons that transition between pages, most of the functions on the website do not work properly as they should (for example, logging in, creating an account, texting (in the chat feed),  or starting a video call). The website consists of visual design components only, and no back-end functions were programmed.

- Moreover, as the target users are laptop users, ideally in their laptop's full screen, most parts of this website are not responsive for mobile and tablet screens.
